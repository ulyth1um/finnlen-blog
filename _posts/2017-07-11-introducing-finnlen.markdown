We started working on Finnlen<sup>1</sup> early in the summer of 2017. Today, we're excited to announce the opening of our online store. Two main things influenced our decision to start a sustainable textiles business. One, trips to big box craft stores left us feeling sad. And two, a long-held interest farming. 

## More Sustainable Home Sewing 

Kate is in her workshop sewing most nights and weekends. Like many home sewers, she's interested in both fashion and creating quality clothing that fits and wasn't made in a sweatshop. Going to a store to pick out fabric and notions should be a fun way to start a project. But she started to dread trips to the big box craft store. Home sewing is one way to make sure your _clothing_ isn't made in a sweatshop, but what about the aisles and aisles of cheap and low-quality fabric, petroleum-based plastic tools that break after two uses? We had a hard time finding anything in these stores that was 100% cotton. And forget about organic or sustainable fabric. When we started asking other home sewers how they felt about buying fabric and supplies they had similar concerns about where these materials came from and how they were produced.

After many disappointing shopping trips, we both started wondering where we might be able to find fabric and sewing supplies that were better for people and the environment. We needed better options.  

So we started looking for organic fabric, sustainably produced supplies, made in the USA or England or Japan â€“ anywhere with basic labor laws. And we discovered that it's hard to find that stuff. While the local fabric and craft stores we visit do a much better job of sourcing supplies from businesses that operate in more ethical ways, it was still rare to find sustainable options. Organics are perhaps easiest to find, but just being organic doesn't always address manufacturing processes or workers' rights. It was surprisingly difficult to find textiles and suppliers that met our criteria of being both truly sustainable and ethically manufactured. Most fabrics address neither, some address one and not the other, while very few do both. We learned that textile production, the way it's done today, is one of the most environmentally harmful manufacturing processes. Textile and clothing production is a notoriously low-cost, high-volume business with a foundation built on sweatshops and harmful agriculture processes.

Sustainable textiles are still hard to find.

They're not yet commonly available in most of the places people go to buy craft supplies. Finding them on your own often requires the home sewer to buy each part of their project from a different place, usually online.

We saw an opportunity to build a business around textiles and sewing supplies the home sewer can feel good about. We wanted to create a definitive source for sustainable home sewing and not just the fabric but the zippers, buttons, thread, and other notions too. We wanted to do the hard part of sourcing and sometimes commissioning those supplies so you can focus on your project. 

## More Sustainable Textile Agriculture 

Most of our friends and family know that the we've been interested in farming for a long time. We've dreamed about one day owning a farm for as long as we've known each other. Over the years, we've worked toward making it happen and we've gotten to know some wonderful people who have taught us a lot about what it means to be a farmer in America today. 

We're interested in helping to support a more local agriculture. It's great to see farmers markets popping up in more places. Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) seems to be more popular than ever. The Farm To Table movement, promoted by independent restaurants, has helped usher in all sorts of renewed interest in where our food comes. It's an exciting time to be interested in local food and agriculture. 

While farmers markets and CSAs are both very positive and we try to support them as much as possible, they only address a very small piece of some very large challenges our country and our world face in farming, agriculture, and our relationship to the countryside.  

Agriculture includes more than just farming for food. Food, water, clothing, and shelter are basic human needs. It makes sense that when we think about ways to address our impact and the burden we put on the environment we look at food. But clothing (with food, water, and shelter) is also a basic human need. As we thought more about sewing and clothing in general, it seemed odd that there was all this attention put on rethinking our relationship to food, but relatively little around clothing or textiles.<sup>2</sup> It's much easier to buy local and more sustainably grown vegetables than it is to buy a shirt or a yard of fabric made in similar ways. But these are both agricultural products. 

The more we talked to people involved with farming or advocating for small farmers the more we realized there was a real need for people with business and marketing experience to help get there products to market. We need more small farms. We also need people to help connect small farmers to people and businesses who want to support them. 

That's where the business concept for Finnlen came from. We want to create a company that connects people interested in sustainable textiles to the farmers, farming communities, and mills involved in the production of fabric, clothing, and notions. We want to encourage a more sustainable and eventually more local textile agriculture. That's what Finnlen is for.

## Who We Are

Kate and I have been working in design, marketing, and sales for more than 10 years. We've worked for two different independent bookstores in Pittsburgh and Louisville, a sustainability publisher, and a big healthcare company. We've been looking for a way to bring everything we've learned working for other people to our own business and to use those skills to do something positive for farming, the environment, and textiles. When we started formalizing the concept behind Finnlen and started working on it everyday we knew we had finally found it. 

## Thank You

Thank you to everyone that helped us get here. Everyone that listened to our ever evolving plans to start a farm<sup>3</sup> and continued to listen while we put all the pieces in place to start Finnlen. With Finnlen, we're not just starting one farm, we'll be supporting many farms and farmers. Thank you to the people that took a chance and invested in our idea by helping fund our opening. And finally, thank  you for buying from Finnlen. 

### Footnotes

1. A portmanteau of Finland and Linen that blends our interest in Scandinavian design with one of our favorite textiles. Also, the .com was available. 
2. Thankfully, there's a small group of businesses and organizations working on it.
3. We might still do that one day!
